# Partners API Introduction

Welcome to Instalocate Partners API! You can use this API to add new bookings to Instalocate platform, set up webhook to get automatic notification, get the latest status of the booking etc. 

###Types of APIs

#### Production Mode
All the production calls should be made to this API url
URL: ```https://partners-prod-api.instalocate.com/v1```

#### Test Mode 
This api should be used for all the testing
URL: ```https://partners-test-api.instalocate.com/v1```

###Authentication:

In order to use the production and test API, every call should have these two parameters - `partner_id` and `api_key`.

* `partner_id` - this id is pre-generated by Instalocate team and is given to the partner. This id will be used to identify partners in every API call. For API documentation, we have created a partner_id for testing.

*  `api_key` - this API key is pre-generated by Instalocate team and is given the partner. The calls will be successful using this API key only. For API documentation, we have created an api key for test purposes only - please don't use this in production.

To generate the production keys, please contact help@instalocate.com. 

###Key Concepts:

* Every itinerary is associated with a booking id (also known as PNR). This booking id should be unique for a given partner. 
* Every booking contains a list of flights. 

###Postman Collections:
